Asynchronous communication is becoming increasingly popular in microservice software systems.
It provides scalable and resilient distributed applications.
In a continuous software development process, software architectures are subject to erosion.
To understand and refactor the architecture at any phase of the development cycle, we require the architecture.
Reverse engineering approaches support architecture extraction for such systems.
In this systematic literature review, we compare five different approaches to extract the architecture of such asynchronous microservice software systems.
We provide an overview of the current state of research in the field and classify the approaches using the five aspects input, approach, output, end user and evaluation.
We conclude that three out of the five approaches are capable of extracting message-based asynchronous communication as well as HTTP RESTful asynchronous communication, while the other two approaches only support HTTP RESTful asynchronous communication.
