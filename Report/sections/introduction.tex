\section{Introduction}
\label{cha:Introduction}
This chapter will provide a motivation of why a systematic literature review about tools for architecture extraction of asynchronous systems is necessary.

In chapter 2, we will provide some foundation knowledge.
In chapter 3, we will talk about the design and goal of this literature review and the selection of the papers.
In chapter 4, we will present the results and compare them using five different aspects.
We will discuss these results in chapter 5 and talk about related work in chapter 6, before drawing conclusions in chapter 7.
