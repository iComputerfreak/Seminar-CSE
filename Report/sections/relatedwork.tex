Ducasse and Pollet \cite{Ducasse2009} performed an extensive comparison of different Software Architecture Extraction approaches by their type of process (bottom-up, top-down or hybrid), input, technique and output.
They compared 34 approaches, none of which are featured in this paper.
None of the approaches presented in this paper were included in the comparison, which is due to the fact that all of the approaches presented in this paper were presented after the year 2009 in which Ducasse and Pollet's paper was released.

Garcia et al. present a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art, automated architecture recovery techniques \cite{Garcia2013comparative}.
They established a ``ground truth'' by carefully verifying eight architectures they extracted from six open-source software systems \cite{Garcia2013comparative}.
Using this ground truth, they then assessed the ability to identify the correct system architecture for each of the eight approaches.
