There exists very little work in comparing software architecture extraction approaches for asynchronous microservice archtiectures.

Ducasse and Pollet \cite{Ducasse2009} performed an extensive comparison of different SAR approaches by their type of process (bottom-up, top-down or hybrid), input, technique and output, similar in structure to this paper.
They compared 34 approaches, none of which are featured in this paper, as none of them supported the extraction of asynchronous architectures.
Also, none of the approaches presented here were included in the paper of Ducasse and Pollet, as all of the approaches compared here were presented after the year 2009, in which Ducasse and Pollet's paper was released.

Garcia et al. present a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art, automated architecture recovery techniques \cite{Garcia2013comparative}.
They established a ``ground truth'' by carefully verifying eight architectures they extracted from six open-source software systems \cite{Garcia2013comparative}.
Using this ground truth, they then assessed the ability to identify the correct system architecture for each of the eight approaches.
