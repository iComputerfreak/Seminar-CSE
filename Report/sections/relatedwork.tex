This chapter presents other papers which are similar to my work.
For example \cite{Ducasse2009}, which compares different SAR approaches to formulate a state-of-the-art approach or \cite{Garcia2013comparative}, which compares different SAR tools.
We will also talk about the fact that \cite{Granchelli2017MicroART} and \cite{Langhammer2016} could be extended to support asynchronous communication in the future.
