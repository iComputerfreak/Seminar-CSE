This chapter will explain the design of the systematic literature review and how it was executed.

\subsection{Study Aim}
\label{sec:StudyDesign:StudyAim}
This section explains the goal of the paper, namely to compare different tools for SAR for asynchronous communication-based systems.

\subsection{Research Questions}
\label{sec:StudyDesign:ResearchQuestions}
This section presents the research questions we will answer in the following sections.

The research questions are: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ1}. What are the tools available for extraction of asynchronous architecture?
	\item \textbf{RQ2}. To what extend do the tools support software architecture extraction?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Selecting the Papers}
